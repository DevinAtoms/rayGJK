# rayGJK
A basic implementation of the GJK algorithm using Raylib rendering. To stay in the spirit of the Raylib Engine, I only used pure C99 and stay self contained.

Big Shoutout to Igor Kroitor for his great explanation of the algorithm, plus building all of the math. I just converted a lot of the Vectors to Raylib types
