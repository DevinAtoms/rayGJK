# rayGJK
### An extremely basic implementation of the GJK algorithm using Raylib rendering.
To stay in the spirit of Raylib as well as just challenging myself, it's self contained and built in pure C.  

Should be easily buildable with CMAKE if for some reason you want to try it out.  

Big Shoutout to @kroitor for the great explanation of the GJK algorithm https://github.com/kroitor/gjk.c.git  
He did all of the real math, I just converted everything to Raylib types/functions and got the shapes rendered.
